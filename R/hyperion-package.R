#' While high-dimensional single-cell based Imaging Mass Cytometry data has
#' demonstrated increased applications in microenvironment composition and
#' solid tumor research, integrated analyzing workflow design for experimental
#' cytometry data has been challenging. Here, we present hyperion, an R package
#' designed for the analysis and interpretation of Imaging Mass Cytometry
#' data. We have applied hyperion to well designed compared-groups Imaging Mass Cytometry
#' Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) data to validate the usage and practical utility of its
#' computational modules. These use cases introduce hyperion as a reliable tool
#' for high-dimensional cytometry data workflow and reveal good performance
#' on trajectory reconstruction and pseudotime estimation.
#' Part of code is from CytoTree R package.
